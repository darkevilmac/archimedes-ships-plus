Want to help make this mod even better, and make sure that it stays updated for future versions of Minecraft? If you're interested in making a feature go ahead and make an issue to see if it's alright, and if you get the go ahead get to work and make a pull request when it's complete. If you have a bug fix the same rules apply, just make sure it's okay before you start working so your code doesn't go to waste!
